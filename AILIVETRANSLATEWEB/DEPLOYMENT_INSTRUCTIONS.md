# 🚀 Client Deployment Instructions

## ✅ Audio Corruption Fixes Applied

The built application includes these critical fixes:
- 🔧 Audio chunk validation (rejects chunks < 500 bytes)
- 🔧 WebM EBML header validation
- 🔧 Increased MediaRecorder interval to 2000ms
- 🔧 Fallback audio format support
- 🔧 Better error handling for corrupted audio

## 📁 Build Output

The `dist/` folder contains:
- `index.html` - Main application
- `assets/` - JavaScript, CSS, and other assets
- `splash.png` - Application splash screen

## 🌐 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Static File Hosting
1. Upload the entire `dist/` folder to your hosting service:
   - Netlify: Drag & drop the `dist/` folder
   - Vercel: `vercel --prod dist/`
   - GitHub Pages: Copy contents to your pages repository
   - Firebase Hosting: `firebase deploy --only hosting`

### Option 2: Manual Server Deploy
1. Copy `dist/` contents to your web server root
2. Ensure your server serves the `index.html` for all routes
3. Configure HTTPS (required for microphone access)

### Option 3: CDN Upload
1. Upload to your CDN service
2. Set up proper MIME types for JavaScript and CSS files

## 🔧 Environment Setup

Before deployment, ensure:
1. Set up environment variables for production:
   - VITE_AZURE_SPEECH_KEY=your_key_here
   - VITE_AZURE_SPEECH_REGION=your_region
   
2. Update server URLs in the build if needed

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

1. Open the deployed application
2. Test microphone access
3. Start recording - you should see:
   - Larger audio chunks (32000+ bytes instead of 16422)
   - No more "EBML header parsing failed" errors
   - Better transcription quality
   - Fewer "No clear speech detected" warnings

## 📊 Expected Improvements

✅ **Before Fix:**
- Small corrupted WebM chunks (16422 bytes)
- EBML header parsing failures
- Poor Azure Speech recognition

✅ **After Fix:**  
- Larger stable chunks (32000+ bytes)
- Valid WebM headers
- Reliable speech recognition
- Better user experience

**🎯 The audio corruption issue should now be resolved!**
