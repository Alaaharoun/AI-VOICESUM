## 🔍 Analysis

### ✅ What's Working:
1. **Server Health:** Server is running and responding to health checks
2. **WebSocket Connection:** WebSocket endpoint is accessible and accepting connections
3. **Message Sending:** Client can send init and audio messages successfully
4. **Data Format:** Audio data is being sent in correct format (base64, PCM)

### ⚠️ What's Missing:
1. **Server Response:** No response messages received from server
2. **Transcription:** No transcription results received
3. **Server Logs:** No detailed server-side logging visible

## 🎯 Root Cause Analysis

### Possible Issues:

1. **Server Logging Issue:**
   - Server might not be logging incoming messages
   - Need to check server-side logging configuration

2. **Message Processing Issue:**
   - Server might be receiving messages but not processing them
   - Need to verify message handling logic

3. **Azure Speech Service Issue:**
   - Azure Speech Service might not be initialized properly
   - Need to check Azure credentials and configuration

4. **Audio Format Issue:**
   - Audio data might not be in the correct format for Azure
   - Need to verify audio conversion process

## 🛠️ Recommended Actions

### 1. Check Server Logs
```bash
# Deploy improved server with enhanced logging
node deploy-improved-server.js
```

### 2. Test with Enhanced Logging
```bash
# Run the improved server and monitor logs
node azure-server-improved.js
```

### 3. Interactive Testing
- Open `test-server-connection.html` in browser
