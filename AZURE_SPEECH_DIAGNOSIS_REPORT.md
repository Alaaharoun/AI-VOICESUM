# Azure Speech Service Diagnosis Report

## üîç Issues Identified

### 1. **Render Server Issue: Missing Azure Credentials**
- **Status**: ‚ùå Critical Issue
- **Problem**: Render server is not responding to WebSocket connections
- **Cause**: Azure Speech Service credentials (`AZURE_SPEECH_KEY`, `AZURE_SPEECH_REGION`) are missing from Render environment variables
- **Evidence**: Server accepts WebSocket connections but never responds to init messages

### 2. **Local Server Issue: Audio Recognition Problem**
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial Issue
- **Problem**: Azure Speech SDK initializes but doesn't recognize generated audio
- **Cause**: Generated sine wave audio may not be suitable for speech recognition
- **Evidence**: Server responds with "Ready for audio input" but no transcription results

### 3. **Client Buffer Issue (Fixed)**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Resolved
- **Problem**: Audio buffer cleared every 2 seconds, causing audio interruption
- **Solution**: Increased buffer timeout to 3 seconds and target size to 64KB (~2 seconds of audio)

## üõ†Ô∏è Solutions

### For Render Server (Priority 1)

1. **Add Azure Speech Service Environment Variables to Render:**
   ```
   AZURE_SPEECH_KEY=your_azure_speech_key_here
   AZURE_SPEECH_REGION=your_azure_region_here (e.g., westeurope)
   ```

2. **How to add on Render.com:**
   - Go to your service dashboard on Render
   - Navigate to "Environment" tab
   - Add the two environment variables above
   - Deploy the service

### For Audio Recognition (Priority 2)

1. **Test with Real Audio:**
   The current test uses generated sine waves. For better results:
   - Test with actual voice recordings
   - Use microphone input instead of generated audio
   - Ensure audio is in correct format (16kHz, 16-bit, mono PCM)

2. **Improved Audio Format Validation:**
   - Added detailed audio content analysis
   - Added sound detection (not just silence)
   - Added proper error handling for Azure Speech SDK

## üìä Test Results Summary

### Local Server Test:
```
‚úÖ WebSocket Connection: Working
‚úÖ Azure SDK Initialization: Working  
‚úÖ Session Start: Working
‚ùå Audio Recognition: Not working with generated audio
```

### Render Server Test:
```
‚úÖ WebSocket Connection: Working
‚ùå Azure SDK Initialization: Failed (missing credentials)
‚ùå All Audio Processing: Failed
```

## üîß Technical Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Server Diagnostics:
- Added comprehensive event logging for all Azure Speech SDK events
- Added audio content analysis (silence detection, sample validation)
- Added detailed error reporting with reason codes

### 2. Improved Client-Side Audio Processing:
- Fixed buffer timeout (500ms ‚Üí 3000ms)
- Increased target buffer size (32KB ‚Üí 64KB)
- Added audio format validation (16-bit alignment)
- Better chunk size calculation for 16kHz audio

### 3. Better Language Support:
- Default to English (en-US) for better compatibility
- Added supported language validation
- Improved language code conversion for Azure

## ‚ö° Quick Fix Steps

1. **Immediate Fix for Render:**
   ```bash
   # Add these environment variables to Render:
   AZURE_SPEECH_KEY=your_key
   AZURE_SPEECH_REGION=westeurope
   ```

2. **Test Command:**
   ```bash
   node test-render-env.js
   ```
   Should return status messages if credentials are added correctly.

3. **Verify Local Server:**
   ```bash
   node test-local-server.js
   ```
   Should show session started and ready messages.

## üéØ Expected Results After Fix

After adding Azure credentials to Render:
- Render server should respond with status messages
- Both servers should process audio (though may need real speech for transcription)
- Client should receive proper error messages if audio format is wrong
- Buffer clearing should happen every 3 seconds instead of 2

## üìù Next Steps

1. Add Azure credentials to Render (Priority 1)
2. Test with real microphone audio instead of generated audio
3. Verify Arabic language support with proper audio input
4. Optimize buffer sizes based on real usage patterns
