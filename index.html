    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2024-07-05</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>AI LIVE TRANSLATE</strong>. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our mobile application (the “App”).<br>
    Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to complying with applicable privacy laws, as well as Google Play policies.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When using our App, we may collect the following types of information:</p>
    
    <h3>a. Audio Recordings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>We collect audio recordings that you choose to transcribe, translate, or summarize.</li>
        <li>Audio data is processed by trusted third-party services (e.g., AssemblyAI, translation APIs) solely to provide you with results.</li>
        <li>Audio data is not stored on our servers permanently, but only temporarily during processing.</li>
    </ul>

        <li>If you sign in with Google or another authentication method, we may collect your name, email address, and profile picture.</li>
        <li>This data is used exclusively to create, manage, and authenticate your account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>c. Device Information</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>We may collect basic device information (e.g., device model, operating system version) to enhance app performance and troubleshoot issues.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
